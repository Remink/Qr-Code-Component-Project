## My process

- I used flexbox, and practiced a bit with width and margins in %.
- To be able to set the width of the image in %, I needed first to set it in a container
- I added a custom font for the first time
- I red a bit of informations about css responsive design, but didn't need it for this project, since a justify-content: center; made my Qr-Code centered for every screen size.
- I needed to set the html height to 100% to make the page take the entire screen to be able to center vertically, not sure why since I didn't have to do that on my other projects !
